   <h2 style="text-align:center;"><font color="white"> Introduction</font> </h2>
  
   <p><font color="white"> Welcome to my page! <br>I am from Edison, NJ and have just completed my Bachelor's
   degree in Supply Chain Management. I did not begin to have an interest in
   information technology until last December and decided to pursue that
   interest by taking classes and learning more. I believe this class will
   definitely prepare me for the future.</br></font> </p>
  
   <h2 style="text-align:center;"><font color="white"><i> Academic Goals<i></font> </h2>
  
   <p><font color="white"> I hope to further my technical skills and learn how to code. I believe this is an
   important skill to have in this generation especially since our daily lives are headed
   towards a technical future. On completion of my graduate certificate, I want to
   continue my studies and complete a master's in Information Technology.</font></p>
  
   <h2 style="text-align:center;"><font color="white">Career Goals</font> </h2>
  
   <p><font color="white">I intend on furthering my skills through these courses as well as through practice and
   hopefully will be able to apply them in the real world as a business analyst or perhaps
   even a developer one day.</font></p>

   <h2 style="text-align:center;"><font color="white">Experience with IT</font></h2>

<p><font color="white"> In my time at undergrad, we had several courses that touched the basics of

	<li>CSS</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
</ol>
